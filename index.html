          Writing for children is a great joy, but it is also a serious
          responsibility.

          I'm sure children are the best readers. They always see in your text
          something special, their imagination allows them to build fantastic
          worlds in their minds. And the most significant responsibility of
          children's authors is to make these worlds full of kindness, love, and
          proper examples. <br />

                    <p>My first book "Star courier" had been published in February 2022, only 3 weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine. During the war, many people have been writing me that their children take my book to the bomb shelters or when they leave their homes and go to other cities or countries. They say my book helps them to keep themselves optimistic and to believe that it is possible to overcome every trouble.</p>
